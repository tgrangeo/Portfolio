		"content": "Hi, my name is Thomas, and I'm a young student developer. I'm always eager to discover new things and have new experiences. I've been learning to code for a few years at the 42 school. My goal as a developer is to become highly versatile, and in 2023, I aim to fully invest myself in my work. I enjoy learning new things and embarking on new experiences. I live in Lyon, and I absolutely love this city. Besides programming, my hobbies include gaming, music, movies, series, and anime. I'm also a firefighter, and I enjoy helping others and working in teams."
