		"content": "Hi, my name is Thomas, and I'm a student developer. I've been learning to code at School 42 for a few years now. My goal as a developer is to be versatile and fully committed to my work in 2023. \n I love learning new things and having new experiences. I live in Lyon, and I adore this dynamic city. Besides development, my hobbies include gaming, music, and watching movies/series/anime. I also enjoy helping others and working in a team.\nI'm passionate about development, always ready to take on new challenges, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends. I believe my determination, curiosity, and ability to work in a team make me a valuable asset.\nIf you'd like to know more about my background and professional aspirations, feel free to contact me. I would be delighted to have a discussion with you.\n"
